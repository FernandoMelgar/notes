#### What is the rational unified process?
The Rational Unified Process is a **Software Engineering Process**. It provides a **disciplined** approach to **assigning tasks** and **responsibilities** within a development organization. Its goal is to ensure the production of high-quality software that meets the needs of its end-users, within a **predictable schedule and budget**.
- **Software Engineering Process**: Has a well defined order of phases and also transitions criteria between this phases.
- **Disciplined**: Has a process and set of instructions that need to be follow.
- **Assigning task**: Task are defined an refined during planning.
- **Responsibilities**: We know in every moment who is in charge of something.
- **Predictable schedule and budget**: We can rely on a system planning for timing, distribution of activities and budget.

#### Unified knowledge base for the team
The Rational Unified Process enhances team productivity, by providing every team member with easy access to a knowledge base with guidelines, templates and tool mentors for all critical development activities. By having all team members accessing the same knowledge base, we ensure that all team members share a common language, process and view of how to develop software.

#### Phases and iterations - the timeline dimension
This is the dynamic organization of the process along time. The software life-cycle is broken into cycles. **RUP** divides one development cycle in four consecutive phases.
- Inception phase.
- Elaboration phase .
-  Construction phase.
-  Transition phase. 

==Each phase is concluded with a well-defined milestone==—a point in time at which certain critical decisions must be made, and therefore key goals must have been achieved.

##### Inception phase
During the inception phase, you ==establish the business case== for the system and ==delimit the project scope==. For this, you need to ==identify all external entities with which the system will interact (actors)== and define the nature of the interactions at a high level. This involves ==identifying all use cases ==and describing a few significant ones.

> The business case includes success criteria, risk assessment, and estimate of the resources needed, and a phase plan showing dates of major milestones. The outcome of the inception phase is:

The outcome of the inception phase is:
- **A vision document**: a general vision of the core project's requirements, key features, and main constraints. 
- A initial use-case model (10% -20%) complete). 
- An initial project glossary (may optionally be partially expressed as a domain model). 
- An initial business case, which includes business context, success criteria (revenue projection, market recognition, and so on), and financial forecast.
- An initial** risk assessment**. 
- A **project plan**, showing phases and iterations. 
-  A business model, if necessary. 
-   One or several prototypes.

###### Milestone : Life-cycle Objectives
At the end of the inception phase is the first major project milestone: the Lifecycle Objectives Milestone. The evaluation criteria for the inception phase are:
- Stakeholder concurrence on scope definition and cost/schedule estimates.
- Requirements understanding as evidenced by the fidelity of the primary use cases. 
- Credibility of the cost/schedule estimates, priorities, risks, and development process. 
- Depth and breadth of any architectural prototype that was developed.
- Actual expenditures versus planned expenditures. 

**The project may be cancelled or considerably re-thought if it fails to pass this milestone.
