## 3. Rapport

> Connect with your conversation partner and help him\\her feel comfortable before talking about a subject

> Friendship, comfort and trust.

Rapport is a kind of friendliness. When you've build rapport with your conversation partner you experience a closeness where you both feel comfortable, get along, mutually empathize, and work towards building trust. It is the most important element in having simple, friendly chats that avoid divisive issues and bring people together.

Viewing conversations as partnerships does most of the work towards having a great conversation, establishing and maintaining a friendly atmosphere improves the situation even further.

The more individuals diverge in their stances, the more important it is to build and maintain rapport, as this connection grows, the persons with whom you're speaking is less likely to be defensive and more open to suggestions

To build rapport, ask sincere questions, that is, questions for which you'd like to find answers, as opposed to asking questions as tactics.

### Practice to build rapport

1.  Build rapport immediately, do not start the conversation with a substantive issue, especially if it is controversial.
2.  Find common ground, there are countless things you and your conversation partner have in common

One automatic commonality all but psychopaths have in common is an impulse for good; you both want the best for yourselves, your friends, and your community. While you might diverge on what those outcomes would look like, living better lives is a foundational commonality.

3.  Do not parallel talk. Parallel talk is taking something someone says and using that to reference yourself or your experience. For example, if someone tells you they just go back from Cuba, don't starting talking about the time you went to Cuba. Ask them about their experience in Cuba. Don't make their stories about your life. Parallel talk damages rapport.

No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care

4.  Friendship engender trust and openness, which act like bridges across divides. This refers to how much you care about them and the things they care about, not about your political or moral commitments.
    
5.  Engage in substantive conversation only if you're willing to make time. DO not rush and do not 'hit and run' If you can't substantively engage someone's ideas, leave it for a time when you can. It impairs rapport to force or speed through conversations. If your time is limited, use the moments you have to build rapport to catch up.
    
6.  Be ready to talk about something else. If the conversation gets sticky, be ready t o change the subject to something less serious.
    
7.  Avoid call-outs, except for severe infractions. Calling out someone means telling them, usually immediately, and in a harsh way that aims at inducing shame. Calling out someone, specially midstream in their thought, damages rapport.
    

Find a more delicate and better-timed way to bring up your concerns. Chances are, your partner is doing the best she can to express her thoughts. Rather than calling out her offenses, try to make sense of what she is saying and appreciate her authenticity, however rough around the edges. Of course, if someone is deliberately rude or abusive, you should stand up for yourself, say something, and set clear boundaries â€” or end the conversation.

8.  Be courteous. Say 'please' and 'thank you'. Also, say 'I appreciate that' after someone offers a counterargument or disagrees with something you've said.
