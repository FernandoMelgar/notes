# HUB Â° Citizenship - Social and Political Practices

## Path to inclusion
We have a preference to surround ourselves with people that are like us.

In-group: Inner most group, people we care about.
Out-group: Coexist but don't care a lot about them. People in our out-group can be excluded, segregated, integrated but not included.

- **Inclusion.** Basic right, embrace all of people regardless of everything. ==When we are truly inclusive, we remove all our barriers of discrimination and intolerance.==
- **Integration.** Incorporation of an individual or a group but ==highlighting their differences and organizing them into categories.== 
- **Exclusion.** Form of discrimination, an individual or a group is not allowed to participate in the life of the community. Exclusion means discrimination. 
- **Segregation.** Group people by some characteristic and persecute them. Segregation is a synonym of oppression. 

**Blind spot.** We discriminate people because they are not how they are supposed to be in our minds.   

## Unit 1: Approaches to the study of citizenship
Citizenship is an old but at the same time new concept.

There are three rights: **civil rights**, **political rights** and **social rights.**

> Complete citizenship structure in 3 categories: civic, social and political rights.

- **Civil citizenship.** Rule of law, equality before the law and individual freedoms. You can enjoy those rights. 
- **Political citizenship.** Political participation, universal suffrage, political parties and labor unions. 
- **Social citizenship.** Welfare state.
- There are related, civil is first than political and political is first than social.

> There's always a struggle for the rights to have rights.

### Citizenship
A **citizen** is a member of a political community who ==enjoys rights ==and ==assumes the duties== of membership denied to non-citizens residing in the country.
