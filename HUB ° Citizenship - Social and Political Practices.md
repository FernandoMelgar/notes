# HUB Â° Citizenship - Social and Political Practices

## Path to inclusion
We have a preference to surround ourselves with people that are like us.

In-group: Inner most group, people we care about.
Out-group: Coexist but don't care a lot about them. People in our out-group can be excluded, segregated, integrated but not included.

- **Inclusion.** Basic right, embrace all of people regardless of everything. ==When we are truly inclusive, we remove all our barriers of discrimination and intolerance.==
- **Integration.** Incorporation of an individual or a group but ==highlighting their differences and organizing them into categories.== 
- **Exclusion.** Form of discrimination, an individual or a group is not allowed to participate in the life of the community. Exclusion means discrimination. 
- **Segregation.** Group people by some characteristic and persecute them. Segregation is a synonym of oppression. 

**Blind spot.** We discriminate people because they are not how they are supposed to be in our minds.   

## Unit 1: Approaches to the study of citizenship
Citizenship is an old but at the same time new concept.

There are three rights: **civil rights**, **political rights** and **social rights.**

> Complete citizenship structure in 3 categories: civic, social and political rights.

- **Civil citizenship.** Rule of law, equality before the law and individual freedoms. You can enjoy those rights. 
- **Political citizenship.** Political participation, universal suffrage, political parties and labor unions. 
- **Social citizenship.** Welfare state.
- There are related, civil is first than political and political is first than social.

> There's always a struggle for the rights to have rights.

### Citizenship
A **citizen** is a member of a political community who ==enjoys rights ==and ==assumes the duties== of membership denied to non-citizens residing in the country. 

**Citizenship** involves ==relations between an individual and a State==: the individual owes allegiance and in turn is entitled to its protection.

### Citizenship theories: Richard Bellamy - Normative and empirical theories

**Normative.** Looks back into past historical models. ==Compares and contrast the current citizen with the old citizen== conception underlining its advantages and disadvantages. Looks back to craft the idea of a virtuous citizen. Includes the rights and obligations that the citizen have. There are norms that need to be followed.

**Empirical.** Based on the social, economic and political reasons in history that have caused the modification of the concept of citizenship. There is a based on the reasons of why the concept of citizenship has been reformed.

The concept of citizenship is composed of three main elements.
- Citizenship as a legal status. Has the right to claim the laws protection, he must follow the rules.
- Citizens as political agents. Actively participates in political institutions.
- Citizenship as membership in a political community. Sense of belonging. Also called the Psychological dimension of citizenship.

Defines citizenship connecting all three elements as a condition of civic equality, as a membership of a political community where all citizens can determine the terms of social cooperation on an equal basis, have equal rights and enjoy collective goods, and equal duties such as participating in the democratic life.

### Classic citizenship theories 

**Liberal theory.** ==Emphasizes the equality of rights which each citizen holds==, and how these rights enable the individual to pursue their aims and goals. Based on the mutual consent between ruler and ruled, thus ==guaranteeing the common good by ensuring the private interest==. Citizens exercised these freedoms primarily in the world of private associations and attachments, rather than in the political domain. Protection from the law, but not participation in political decisions. Has the right to associate privately.

**Republican theory.** ==Empowers and identifies the citizen as the ruler himself and not as a subject of authority.== Equal participation in government as the foundation for the promotion of the civic self-rule (rule and being ruled). The civic self-rule is what makes citizens free and laws legitimate. Active participation and decision-making ensures that individuals are citizens, and not only subjects. 

## Citizenship values
- **Values of participation.** Include a view of problems as their own to help resolve. Citizens are motivated to make a difference and take action. Perseverance, cooperation, inclusion and fairness. Always the interest of common good. Obtaining justice and equality for everyone.
- **Values of the individual.** Behave morally and ethically towards others. Understand their values and challenge. Integrity, honesty, compassion and respect. This person is aware of their own values.
- **Values of the community.** Intention to belong and contribute. Shared understanding, agreed values and principles. Responsibility, tolerance and solidarity.
