## Path to inclusion
We have a preference to surround ourselves with people that are like us.

In-group: Inner most group, people we care about.
Out-group: Coexist but don't care a lot about them. People in our out-group can be excluded, segregated, integrated but not included.

- **Inclusion.** Basic right, embrace all of people regardless of everything. ==When we are truly inclusive, we remove all our barriers of discrimination and intolerance.==
- **Integration.** Incorporation of an individual or a group but ==highlighting their differences and organizing them into categories.== 
- **Exclusion.** Form of discrimination, an individual or a group is not allowed to participate in the life of the community. Exclusion means discrimination. 
- **Segregation.** Group people by some characteristic and persecute them. Segregation is a synonym of oppression. 

**Blind spot.** We discriminate people because they are not how they are supposed to be in our minds.
