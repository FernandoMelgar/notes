## Path to inclusion
We have a preference to surround ourselves with people that are like us.

In-group: Inner most group, people we care about.
Out-group: Coexist but don't care a lot about them. People in our out-group can be excluded, segregated, integrated but not included.

- Inclusion: Basic right, embrace all of people regardless of everything. When we are truly inclusive  
- Exclusion:
- Segregation
- Integration
