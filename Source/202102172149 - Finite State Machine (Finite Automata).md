> FSM are the simplest model of computation

> FSM have a very limited memory

Also known as **Finite Automata** and is divided in two categories:
1. **Finite Automata with output.**
	1. Moore Machine
	2. Mealy Machine
2. **Finite Automata without output.**
	1. Deterministic Finite Automata
	2. Nondeterministic Finite Automata
	3. $\varepsilon NFA$
