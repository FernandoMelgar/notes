## Path to inclusion
**In-group and out-group**
	- We are indifferent with the out-group.
	- An in-group is much much smaller. 
	
	
Inclusion, exclusion, segregation and integration.
- Segregation includes oppression.

**what is a prejudice?** It's a preconceive idea that can't change.  We exclude when someone it's not as we imagine it in our mind.
