# How to take smart notes?
- Notes need to be organized by context not by folder.
- Can use the approach to asking the right kind of questions.
	- First gain a whole picture of the topic, then respond the questions you would like.
- There are different types of notes:
	- Fleeting notes: Quick and dirty, unfinished.
	- Literature notes: Thoughts related to literature, need a source.
	- Permanent notes: Finished notes notes.
		- I think we can have in this category, two more type of notes.
			- Thinking notes: Here I describe all the thinking process, with the clashing ideas, this is more a self conversation.
			- Output notes: This can be described as finished notes, this is some kind of output for my system.
- Use @ to detone people e.g @Fernando_Melgar
